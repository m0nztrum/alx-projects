# Issue Summary

## Duration:

Start Time: 2024-02-16 08:00 AM UTC
End Time: 2024-02-16 11:30 AM UTC

## Impact:

The outage affected our user authentication service, rendering it completely unavailable for approximately 3.5 hours. During this period, all users attempting to log in experienced login failures, impacting 60% of our user base.

## Root Cause:

The root cause of the outage was identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, leading to an inability to distribute incoming traffic evenly among authentication servers.

# Timeline:

-   **Detection:**

    -   2024-02-16 08:15 AM UTC
    -   The issue was initially detected through an influx of user complaints regarding login failures. Simultaneously, monitoring systems triggered alerts for increased error rates in the authentication service.

-   **Actions Taken:**

    -   08:20 AM UTC: The engineering team initiated an investigation into the authentication service logs and load balancer configurations.
    -   09:00 AM UTC: Assumptions pointed towards a potential database overload, leading to skewed traffic distribution. Database servers were checked and ruled out.
    -   09:45 AM UTC: The investigation focused on network connectivity issues between the load balancer and authentication servers.

-   **Misleading Paths:**

    -   A false assumption was made regarding a possible DDoS attack, leading to unnecessary time spent analyzing network traffic patterns.
    -   Temporary measures were taken to increase server capacity, believing it to be a performance-related issue, exacerbating the problem.

-   **Escalation:**

    -   10:30 AM UTC: The incident was escalated to the infrastructure team as the root cause remained unidentified. Senior engineers joined the investigation.

-   **Resolution:**
    -   11:30 AM UTC: The misconfiguration in the load balancer settings was identified and corrected. Normal traffic distribution was restored, resolving the authentication service outage.

# Root Cause and Resolution:

-   **Root Cause:**

    -   The load balancer was misconfigured, causing it to favor specific authentication servers over others. This resulted in an uneven distribution of traffic, leading to some servers being overloaded while others remained underutilized.

-   **Resolution:**
    -   Load balancer configurations were corrected to evenly distribute incoming traffic among authentication servers. This was achieved through a combination of manual adjustments and automated scripts to ensure a balanced allocation of resources.

# Corrective and Preventative Measures:

-   **Improvements/Fixes:**

    -   Regular audits of load balancer configurations to catch misalignments promptly.
    -   Implementing additional monitoring for real-time visibility into traffic distribution patterns.
    -   Conducting regular training sessions for the operations team to enhance their ability to identify and resolve misconfigurations promptly.

-   **Tasks:**
    -   Automate load balancer configuration checks with scheduled scripts.
    -   Establish clear communication channels for incident reporting and escalation.
    -   Conduct a comprehensive review of the incident to identify areas for process improvement.

This postmortem serves as a valuable learning experience, highlighting the importance of thorough configuration reviews and quick identification of potential misconfigurations to minimize service outages.
