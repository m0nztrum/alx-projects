# Stack and Queue Implementation in C

This C project provides implementations of two fundamental data structures: Stacks and Queues. Stacks are based on the LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) principle, while Queues are based on the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) principle. These data structures are essential for various applications in computer science and programming.

## Overview

In computer science, a Stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) principle. It means that the element added last will be the first one to be removed. Stacks are often used for managing function calls, undo operations, and in algorithms like depth-first search.

On the other hand, a Queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) principle. It means that the element added first will be the first one to be removed. Queues are commonly used in task scheduling, breadth-first search, and more.

### FIFO (First-In-First-Out)

A Queue operates based on the FIFO principle, which means that the first element enqueued is the first one to be dequeued.

## Stacks

### Stack Operations

This project provides the following stack operations:

-   `push(item)`: Adds an item to the top of the stack.
-   `pop()`: Removes and returns the item from the top of the stack.
-   `peek()`: Returns the item at the top of the stack without removing it.
-   `isEmpty()`: Checks if the stack is empty.

## Queues

### Queue Operations

This project provides the following queue operations:

-   `enqueue(item)`: Adds an item to the rear of the queue.
-   `dequeue()`: Removes and returns the item from the front of the queue.
-   `peek()`: Returns the item at the front of the queue without removing it.
-   `isEmpty()`: Checks if the queue is empty.

## `Monty` executes the following opcodes:

## Brainfuck

`Brainfuck` (often abbreviated as BF) is an esoteric programming language created in 1993 by Urban Müller. It is known for its extreme minimalism and is designed to be a challenging and quirky language with just a small set of commands. Brainfuck is intentionally difficult to write and read, making it more of a novelty or educational programming language rather than a practical one.

Here are the key features of Brainfuck:

-   `Minimalistic Commands:` Brainfuck uses only eight simple commands, which are represented by single characters: +, -, >, <, [, ], ., and ,.
-   `Tape-Based Memory:` Brainfuck operates on an array of memory cells, each initially set to zero. A data pointer points to the current cell.

-   `commands:`

```
+ and -: Increment and decrement the value in the current memory cell, respectively.
```

```
> and <: Move the data pointer to the right or left, changing the current memory cell.
```

```
[ and ]: Conditional loops. While the current memory cell is nonzero, the code between [ and ] is executed.
```

```
.: Output the character in the current memory cell as a character.
```

```
,: Input a character and store its ASCII value in the current memory cell.
```

-   `Limited Memory:` The memory in Brainfuck is typically quite limited, consisting of a fixed number of cells (usually 30,000) and only capable of holding small integer values.

-   `No I/O or Arithmetic Operations:` Brainfuck lacks built-in arithmetic operators or I/O functions. It relies on the programmer to implement any complex logic.

-   `Whitespace Ignored:` Any characters other than the eight Brainfuck commands are treated as whitespace and are ignored by the interpreter.
